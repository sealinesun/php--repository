I use the Repository pattern. Often. And if you're a fan of Laravel (like me), you're probably a fan of [Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/collections). This library includes simple implementations of both.

## Installation
Do this, then relax:
```
composer require guillermoandrae/php-repository
```

## Testing
Run the following command to make sure you don't ruin the code coverage percentage:
```
composer check-coverage
```

Run the following command to make sure your code is appropriately styled:
```
composer check-style
```

Run the following command to invoke both of the above commands easily:
```
composer test
```
