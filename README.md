I use a simple implementation of the Repository pattern, and I also use a pared-down version of [Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/collections). Often. I've been copying and pasting the same code between projects for longer than I care to admit; I came to my senses recently, and that's why this project now exists.

## Installation
Do this, then relax:
```
composer require guillermoandrae/php-repository
```

## Testing
Run the following command to make sure you don't ruin the code coverage percentage:
```
composer check-coverage
```

Run the following command to make sure your code is appropriately styled:
```
composer check-style
```

Run the following command to invoke both of the above commands easily:
```
composer test
```
